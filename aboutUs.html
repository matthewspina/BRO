<p2>The Barrier Reef Orchestra has been around for almost twenty years. It all started back in the late nineties when a large group of people including musicians, artist and general people that have a love for music developed the idea that they could create an orchestra for our great region. In the year 2000, to kick start the program a workshop was held in which musicians from everywhere were invited to participate under the baton of Richard Mclntyre, a senior lecturer in Canberra. The workshop received much success and as a result, the Barrier Reef Orchestra was developed.</p2>
<p2 style = "margin-top: 250px;">Now, in a typical year, the Barrier Reef Orchestra performs around three big concerts a year featuring guest conductors and other performing groups. As well, With the popularity of the Barrier Reef Orchestra growing, throughout the year they are asked many times to perform at special events such as the Townsville Arts Awards.</p2>
