<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> The pluses of working in this group was that the communication was easily handled. Also, as we were both relatively new to web design, it was easy to learn a lot of new stuff as a team working on the website. Also, as there was only two members to our group, it was easy to divide the workload evenly so one member was doing more work then the other.</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> The negatives of this group was, although stated as a plus, we were both relatively new to web design. Although, it made learngin a lot easier, it started out slow at the start and was difficult for quite some time. But as time progressed, we learnt more and it got a lot easier. </p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> What we learned is that although both working on the same project, it could be seen that each member could do their own thing, and the website would still join together.</p>
