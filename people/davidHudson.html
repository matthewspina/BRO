<p>Pop musician, vocal coach and session vocalist, is known for his very wide vocal range. Lopez is the proud owner of many studio albums and singles such as, "Paper Boat", released in 2014. With both parents being musicians, Lopez was a treble by age 10. He studied at the Griffith University in Australia for a total of 10 years developing his incredible vocal talent. </p>
<p>In 2005, he put his great talent to the test and broke not one, but two world records. He currently holds the record for the highest vocal of a male and held the previous record for singing a C#8 </p>
<p>It was an honor to say the least to see Adam Lopez alongside Sean O'Boyle and James Morrison perform with th Barrier Reef Orchestra in 2012. </p></div>
