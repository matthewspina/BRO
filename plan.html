<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>The goal of this website is to promote the Slammers volleyball club with the outcome being an increase in people joining the club and sport.</p>
<h3>Success Evaluation</h3>
<p>The success of this site will be measured through an increase of customers. <br>
The client wishes to see at least a 50% increase in customers before they will consider the site a success</p>
<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>The target audience for this website is 15 to 30 year olds.<br>
This will be shown in the websites design through the use of a more 'mature' colour scheme as opposed to a bright and in your face colour scheme.<br>
Also, this website will cater to the short attention span of a high school student by having all of the important information towards the center of the screen.</p>
