<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>The goal for this assessment is to make a new website for the Barrier Reef Orchestra. Furthermore, we must evaluate the previous website and using the requirements given by the client, improve it substantially. In doing this, it is hoped that the client will be satisfied as it will give more people information about the organisation, therefore increasing interest in membership and attending concerts. </p>
<h3>Success Evaluation</h3>
<p>The success of this project will be seen in the increase of interest in the organisation. This will be seen in the increase of members and people at concerts. Even though the client did not specify an exact increase in members or audience numbers that they want, it is believed that this project will be considered successful if there is any increase in interest for this organisation.</p>
<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>The client stated that they would like an increase in all ages. But, as the viewing group is currently mostly people of the older age group, the client would like predominantly see in increase of younger people as they are the future of the orchestra. This will be accounted for in the website by decreasing the amount of bulk information on each page so it is not boring for the viewer</p>
